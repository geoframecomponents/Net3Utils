# Net3Utils

---

This project contains the classes used to connect the nodes of a graph within Net3.

## Recent Changes

- Added `SumLog` and `SumSqrt` operators for alternative scaling of summed inputs.
- Added `Sum30` for aggregating many inflows in large basins and reservoirs.
- Added `inNonNode` to allow inputs from a different Node (use with caution).
- Added `Out1deriv` to output derivations for dams or river branches.
